# Would you Rather

This is a React-Redux project for Udacity Nano degree.

In this Project, users can play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user can ask a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Others will be asked to select the answer based on their own preference.
